# Next.js + NextAuth.js + Prisma + Tailwind CSS

This was created from [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) and I've added a few personal stuff so I don't need to do it if I want to create a new project.

## What's this made of?
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [Prisma](https://prisma.io)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

# Run

```sh
npm install
```
```sh
npm run dev
```
